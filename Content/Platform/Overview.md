# Overview of the Particular Software Messaging Platform


## Introduction

The Particular Software Messaging Platform is an integrated set of products and tools enabling you to develop, test and run distributed systems.

OK, but what does this actually mean ?

Developing distributed applications and systems is hard. Really hard.
Just think of all you need to do:
* Envision and design the distributed system 
* Create a POC
* Demo it and communicate your intent to peers, managers and customers
* Receive feedback and iterate to make sure you're on the right track
* Add the business logic and your system's unique "secret sauce" 
* Test and make sure it all fits together and working as planned 
* Deploy to production and continuously monitor 
* Track customer usage and handle any exceptions
* Improve, fix, upgrade and update while making sure it all works flawlessly

This is quite a challenge, and although the industry has been making  progress, both in methodology and tooling, it still requires a steep learning curve and significant effort to master distributed systems development. 

**Our goal is simple: Make it fun, easy and fast to design, develop and run distributed systems.**

The Particular Software Messaging Platform, developed by the makers of NServiceBus, the most popular and developer friendly service bus for .NET, takes distributed development to the next level of ease and efficiency:
* A comprehensive set of tools supporting the entire lifecycle of distributed applications development
* Following established best practices and methodological guidelines
* Built for and using NServiceBus, the most popular Service Bus for the .NET environment
* End-to-end Support for a wide array of messaging transports (including MSMQ, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, SQL Server, Windows Azure Queues, Windows Azure Service Bus, WebsphereMQ and more)
